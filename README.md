# Filtronaut
*The Filtronaut has the filters to navigate you to open windows, recent documents, bookmarks and more.*

Filtronaut is a lightweight AutoHotkey utility that lets you quickly switch between open windows, recent files, favorites and bookmarks with filtered lists, fast and easy to use with the keyboard alone.

## Features
- Hotkey-driven mode switching (Alt-O for **O**pen windows, Alt-B for **B**ookmarks, Alt-P for recent **P**dfs, etc.)
- Currently 9 built-in modes
- Define additional modes or custom hotkeys with optional config file
- Live filtering of items via text input with Tab completion
- Instant activation of selected item via Return
- Arrow key navigation within the list

## How It Works
- Press Alt-Esc to open Filtronaut (see *Config File*)
- Switch modes using hotkeys:
    - Alt-O → **O**pen windows (default)
    - Alt-R → **R**ecent files
    - Alt-F → **F**avorites
    - Alt-B → **B**ookmarks (MS Edge only)
    - Alt-M → **M**edia (WMP)
    - Alt-W/X/P/D → recent **W**ord/e**X**cel/**P**df/**D**irectories
    - Additional modes can be defined in the *Config File*
    - Sniplet modes to filter, insert, expand, sort lines of text files (see *Sniplets*)
- Start typing to filter the list
- Press Alt-C to toggle **C**ase sensitive search
- Press Tab to auto-complete filter text until next significant letter
- Press Down and Up to navigate the list
- Press Return to run or bring to front the current selection
- Define hotkeys to open it on a given screen maximised or with a special geometry
- Press Ctrl-Plus to add the current input to sniplets or current item to favorites
- Press Ctrl-Backspace to close the selected window, remove recent link or sniplet
- Sort the sniplet list by moving items with Ctrl-Up and Ctrl-Down
- Copy the selection to the filter text with Alt-Return
- Press Esc to close the Filtronaut window or Ctrl-Esc to exit the app
- Ctrl-H for **H**elp window
- Alternatively, use the mouse to change mode, scroll the list and select an item

## Known Limitations
- Bookmarks support is currently limited to Microsoft Edge format
- Opening windows with given layout does not always work
- Only .lnk files are read from Favorites and Recent folders.
- Mouse click limited to selecting the first item with the given name in the list

## Sniplets ##
In the config file, you can define Hotkeys along with a text file to be opened as list. For example,
this could be a list a phrases you need every now and then. Type some part of the phrase you remember
and press Return to enter the phrase in your current document. To add a phrase, type it as filter text
(or insert it from the clipboard with Ctrl-V) and press Ctrl-+ to append it to the current sniplet list.

Another use for sniplets is an e-mail address book. You can define a hotkey with a mailto: action to
directly open your e-mail editor to send a mail to the selected person.

Sniplets can also serve as a handy todo-list: always just a hotkey away, type a task during the call,
add it with Ctrl-+. Later sort the list with Ctrl-Up/Down or delete finished tasks with Ctrl-Backspace.
